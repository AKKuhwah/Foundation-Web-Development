        <h3>Why Is Physical Health Important</h3>
        <p>
            Physical health is vital for optimal daily 
            functioning, mental well-being, and longevity. 
            It bolsters the immune system, curbs chronic 
            disease risks, and boosts energy levels. Good 
            physical health supports better sleep, mood 
            regulation, and cognitive function, laying 
            the groundwork for a fulfilling life and the 
            pursuit of goals.
